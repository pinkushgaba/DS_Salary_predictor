3.3"|Software Engineer III - Conversational AI|Sunnyvale, CA|"Position Summary...

What you'll do...

The Cortex team is the core A.I. platform powering the vision of
delivering the world's best intelligent personal assistants to Walmart's
customers, accessible via natural voice commands, text messages, rich UI
interactions, and a mix of all of the above via multi-modal experiences.

We believe /conversations/ are a natural and powerful user interface for
interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences -
both online and in-store. We are building and designing the next
generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other
teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences:
from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri, Google Assistant,
[Text to Shop]), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich,
intertwined, multi-modal interaction modes ([Me@Walmart]).

Interested in diving in?

We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to
design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of
the following areas:

Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU
capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model
orchestration.

Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart
customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to
solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and
availability.

You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate
model-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies,
and improving the /combined/ latency and robustness of such
microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single
request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer).

You will also bake-in functionality which can drive improved machine
learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing.

Model serving and operations

There is a constant tension between model improvements (more
computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a
quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and
controlling the operational costs.

You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in
terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / ONNYX? /
Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model
serving - based on the latest model developments and product
requirements.

In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load-testing
efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and
tune/optimize the model-serving stack.

Tooling, infrastructure and pipelines for reproducible workflow and
models, enabling rapid innovation across the entire product lifecycle.

You will author and maintain pipelines that safely build and deploy
models to production via continuous deployment.

You will achieve scalable and efficient resource management
capabilities (cloud infrastructure).

You will provide robust and built-in diagnostics for quality control
throughout.

- You will integrate - or build - labeling tools which can
seamlessly integrate at the heart of our conversation data store
(GCP, BigQuery) and intertwine multiple labeling sources of various
confidence levels.

Come at the right time, and you will have an enormous opportunity to
make a massive impact on the design, architecture, and implementation of
an innovative, mission critical product, used every day, by people you
know, and which customers love.

As part of the emerging tech group, you will also have the additional
opportunity of building demos, proof of concepts, creating white papers,
writing blogs, etc.
